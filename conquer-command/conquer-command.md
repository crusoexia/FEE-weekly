## Elephant In The Room

It is third decade in the 21th Century, Why do people still invent languages and tools with CLI interface?

(GUI is good, but it is mainly for end users, has limitation for technique tasks.)

===

Example: File system operation.

Copy file(s) with Graphic UI:

Copy file(s) with CLI:

```sh [2]
j workspace
cp ~/Downloads/*snapshot.* ./
```

===

Clean & Elegant!

===

But it is not the whole story.

TODO: An example to demonstrate the charactoristic of cli(composition).

Automation: The Must-Have ability for development tools and Pipeline.

## The deep reason that make CLI special and vibrant

1. Unified and simple input & output. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. Concentrate and self-contained individual module. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Each module just "filter" the input. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. Compose the modules to accomplish complicate tasks.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
-- The design principle of Unix <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

## Unlimited possibility

Boost the hundreds of thousands CLI applications with ChatGPT without a single-line code change. - The true power of the CLI.

## Overral, the CLI has a long history since 1960s. It is the UI created by the developers for developers.
