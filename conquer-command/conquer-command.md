2. Concentrate and self-contained individual module. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Each module just "filter" the input. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. Compose the modules to accomplish complicate tasks.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
