# TDD workshop #1

Through this workshop we will use typescript and TDD method to implement a **Todo list** as [this](https://backbonejs.org/examples/todos/index.html).

---

# 1. Create a new react project with typescript enabled

```
npx create-react-app my-todo --typescript
```

run `yarn test` and `yarn start` to test whether the project create successful.

---

# 2. Task breakdown

Play with the [todo list](https://backbonejs.org/examples/todos/index.html), figure out how to break this app down into small pieces.

---

# 3. Pick one smallest individual task, write a basic functional specification test for it

---

# 4. Implement code to make the specification pass

---

# 5. Write another specification for this task, repeat the steps *3* - *4* until all functional specification have been finished.
