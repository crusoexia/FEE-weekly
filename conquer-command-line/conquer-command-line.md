## So, why do you want to use CLI?

It is third decade in the 21th Century,

_why do people still invent apps and tools with CLI interface?_

Notes: GUI is good, but it is mainly for end users, has limitation for technique tasks.

===

## Example: Move file(s).

===

Move file(s) with GUI:

1. Open "finder"(or anything else) 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="1" -->
2. Click after clicks to get the place where the files locate 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="2" -->
3. Select the file 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="3" -->
4. Hold the ctrl + select another file 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="4" -->
5. Repeat this until all the files you want to move are selected
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="5" -->
6. Right click the mouse 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="6" -->
7. Select "cut" 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="7" -->
8. Open another "finder" 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="8" -->
9. Click after clicks to the target place 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="9" -->
10. Right click mouse 
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="10" -->
11. Select the "paste"
<!-- .element: style="font-size:28px;margin:5px" class="fragment" data-fragment="11" -->

===

Tedious! &#x1F44E;

Not to mention the "finder" is really __SUCKS__.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

===

Move file(s) with CLI:

```sh
mv ~/Downloads/*snapshot.* ~/workspace/my-project/images/
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Clean & Elegant!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

More important, it is repeatable.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

===

__Command it__, be machine's master, not slave.

But it is not just that...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

===

## Application cooperation
Leverage Effect

===

Imagine you want to do below task: 

1. Use a tool that generate a random humorous sentence. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment="1" -->
2. Wrapped the sentence in the bubble of a cow to make it more humorous. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment="2" -->
3. Copy it in clipboard so that you can paste it to your Wechat moments. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment="3" -->

===

With GUI applications

Suppose you have one app that generate humors, and one app to render a "cow" to wrap a sentence:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

**Repeatly** _Double click to open app -> click to function -> copy / paste result_
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Tedious! &#x1F44E;
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

===

With CLI:

```sh
fortune | cowsay | xclip -sel clip
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

&#x1F389;Voila!&#x1F389;
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

===

## Unlimited possibility - Magics from the future

===

The CLI applications would not only cooperate with each others, but they are also boost by the application which even not been created.

__Without a single-line change__.

===

Don't believe it? Check the [shell_gpt](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt)!

Now you have 10s of thousands of applications which have the world's best AI capability, __for free__!
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

===

## Other capabilities
* Scripting
* Automation

===

From here you could get idea of the power of the CLI.

===

## The deep reason that make CLI special and vibrant

1. Unified and simple input/output across the system. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. Each application focus on a small area. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Most of the applications just "filter" the input. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. Application cooperation is encouraged and simply by "composition". <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
-- The design principle of Unix <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

===

&#x261D; Overral, the CLI is a UI created by the developers for developers, it opens a door for play and hacking.

# Theory - Unix File System

The fear comes from unfamiliar.

===

## Everything is a file(descriptor)

===

Documents, hard-drives, keyboard, screen, clipboards, printers, network streams... anything you can imagine, are files(with different types).

__So that the same set of tools, utilities and APIs can be used on them.__
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

===

For example

Observe the result of `ls > list.txt && cat list.txt` and `ls | cat`

Note: read.mjs

===

> In facts, _pipe_ (|) acts as a temporary file which hold the output of one command and exists until next command read it.

===

## Unix(like) file system hierarchy

Where to find the stuffs and where should you place them.

===

| Directory         | Description                                                               | Shareable |

| **/var**          | Files that may change often â€“ especially in size                          |           |
<!-- .element: style="font-size:20px" -->

Note: All data in Unix is organized into files. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the file system.

===

/home/\<user>/ hierarchy

| Directory                | Description                                                                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /home/\<user>/Documents/ | Your personal documents                                                              |
| /home/\<user>/Desktop/   | The files you place on your GUI desktop are all locate at there                      |
| /home/\<user>/Download/  | Files downloaded by user applications for example the browser.                       |
| /home/\<user>/Picture/   | Used by the photo applications and screen captures                                   |
| /home/\<user>/bin/       | Your private executables                                                             |
| /home/\<user>/.config/   | Configurations of applications                                                       |
| /home/\<user>/.local/    | Files installed by user applications other than the OS distribution package managers |
| /home/\<user>/.ssh/      | ssh related files like private/public keys and known hosts                           |

# Theory - Unix privilege and User group

`sudo rm -rf /` &#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;

===

## Caution!

Don't run above command in your terminal, otherwise the author of this slides don't responsible for any lost of doing so!

===

Unix is a multi-user multi-tasking OS, it has been born with consideration of dividing user's resource and privileges.

===

## Definition

* __User__ - Accounts tied either to people, or specific applications.
* __Group__ - Users within a group can read, write, or execute files owned by that group.

&#x261D; A user has an associate primary group(usually the same name as the user name).
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

&#x261D; A user can be assigned to multiple groups.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

===

## User types

* __Normal user__ - A mortal user which would login the system.
* __System user__ - Users used by system applications or special purpose. Login is disabled.

===

Standard Users(System users)

| User   | UID | GID | Home Directory | Shell         |
|--------|-----|-----|----------------|---------------|
| root   | 0   | 0   | /root          | /bin/bash     |
| bin    | 1   | 1   | /bin           | /sbin/nologin |
| daemon | 2   | 2   | /sbin          | /sbin/nologin |
| adm    | 3   | 4   | /var/adm       | /sbin/nologin |
<!-- .element: style="font-size:.6em" -->

See the full list [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/4/html/reference_guide/s1-users-groups-standard-users).
<!-- .element: style="font-size:.6em" -->

===

Standard Groups

| Group  | GID | Members           |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| root   | 0   | root              |
| bin    | 1   | root, bin, daemon |
| daemon | 2   | root, bin, daemon |
| sys    | 3   | root, bin, adm    |
| adm    | 4   | root, adm, daemon |
<!-- .element: style="font-size:.6em" -->

See the full list [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/4/html/reference_guide/s1-users-groups-standard-groups).
<!-- .element: style="font-size:.6em" -->

===

&#x261D; The "Minimal Privilege Principle" is applied to assign restricted actions to different `standard` user and groups.

===

## The sovereign Sudoers!

**sudo** stands for "Super User Do". So Sudoers are super users(root users), are usually the system owner or admin.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

&#x261D; The sudoers' specification are stored in `/etc/sudoers`
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

===

## User and Group management tools

Refer to [Redhat User and Group Management Tools](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/4/html/reference_guide/ch-users-groups)

===

## Practice: Check user groups

`id [options] [user]`

```sh
$ id root
```
Output:

uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),1(daemon),2(kmem),3(sys),4(tty),5(operator),8(procview),9(procmod),12(everyone),20(staff),29(certusers),61(localaccounts),80(admin),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1),33(_appstore),98(_lpadmin),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer),250(_analyticsusers),395(com.apple.access_ftp),398(com.apple.access_screensharing),399(com.apple.access_ssh),400(com.apple.access_remote_ae),703(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3)
<!-- .element: style="font-size: .5em;overflow-wrap:break-word;text-align:left" -->

===

## File Permission

* Each file has 3 level of permission `read`, `write`, and `execute` separately for the `user owner`, the `group owner`, and `others`.
* The file owner can be changed only by the root user. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* File access permissions can be changed by both the root user and the owner of the file. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

===

![File permission demonstration](./images/file-permission.svg)

===

&#x261D; Dy default the user who creates a file is the owner that file. The creator's primary group is the group owner of the file.

&#x261D; There are more advanced permission controls like `special permission` and `ACL`(Access control list).
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

===

## The privilege of process

The process and its sub-processes have the same access right as the user who start the process.

&#x261D; Don't abuse *sudo* to run applications! That means this application can do anything on your system(like `rm -rf /`), so does the sub-processes spawned by it.

## Terminal

===

Terminals are many, but there is a critical capability to filter them: *Standby for your call with an identified command*.

![quake console](./images/quake-console.png)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" style="height: 400px" data-fragment-index="1" -->

===

Compare with searching in a messed list with `tab` and eyes(and brain), using `ctrl/cmd + ;` to summon and dismiss the terminal is JUST elegant!

===

Recommond terminals:

* Mac - *iterm2*
* Windows - *Windows terminal*
* Linux - *Guake*; *Gnome terminal*

===

## tmux
The magic amplifier.

Get what you need right at your hand.

Now you have your CLI, you still want diff workspaces for different things, and a way to quick and accuate switch between them.

===

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/introduction-tmux-linux

===

Introduct concepts

Session, Window, Pane

===

![tmux](./images/tmux.svg)

===

* Session management
  - Create Session
  - Attach Session
  - Switch Session
* Window management
  - Create Window
  - Window navigation
  - Search/Switch Window
  - Swap window
  - Move window to session
* Pane management
  - Create Pane
  - Pane navigation
  - Pane position
  - Move Pane to window

===

Tmuxinator

Predefined tmux workspace

===

## oh-my-zsh

Capability enabled:
* auto-completion
* better autojump
* better vi-mode
* better history management
* pretty
* and more

===

One downside of the CLI is you have to remember the commands and their options(usability). 

__Auto-completion__ can dramatically resolve this problem.

# Login shell

TODO: what is loginshell(The first program to start when you login into the system)?

ANSWER: https://linuxhandbook.com/login-shell/
ANSWER: https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/courses/IC221/classes/L03/Class.html

===

**Practice** - Check your login shell

Through `/etc/passwd`

![etc passwd file explained](https://linuxhandbook.com/content/images/2021/01/etc-passwd-file-explained.png)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

===

Tips: The first program for non-login user:

```sh
daemon:*:1:1:System Services:/var/root:/usr/bin/false
```

===

**Practice** - Check current running shell
1. `echo $SHELL`
2. `echo $0` - prefix with `-` if a login shell

===

# Non-login shell

Subshell: In Linux, when you run a shell script, it runs in its own shell (a non-interactive shell). You can start a new shell from your current shell (an interactive shell). 

===

# Config files for login-shell

===

TODO: the graphic to display the apply order of login-shell config files

## switch user

su

===

## Shell config files

* /etc/profile, /etc/zprofile etc.
* .profile, .bash_profile, .zprofile etc.
  - alias cannot be defined in profile
* .*rc

TODO: Difference between .profile and .*rc: only login shell would use them?

TODO: This allows you to have tab completion, colored output and sets other stuff such as umask etc.
